# REUBOT - The LinkedIn Posting Bot

### **Version 1.0**
---
### Vision
The idea behind the creation of this bot is to help the user to focus on posting with no distractions.
Many users on LinkedIn that enter the platform to post content finds it difficult to ignore their friends posts that prompt them upon entrance, cutting out their thread of thought and leaving them to spend too much time scrolling down on posts.

This bot is here to change the way content creators engage with the platform.

### How it works?
The code has 3 layers:
1. The main python script, which uses Selenium's library to process the web browser.
2. A library of strings, so the main code would look much more pythonic.
3. The user's identification info - email and password.

For now, version 1.0, this code can run only on your personal machine, with no server application in the near future.
